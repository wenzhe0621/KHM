This repository contains a Shiny app for visualizing and interacting with data related to Kernel-based History Matching (KHM). The app allows users to explore the results interactively through various plots and tables.

The Shiny app consists of the following files:

1. global.R: Contains code that is shared across the app, such as loading libraries and datasets.
2. server.R: Contains the server logic, which defines how the app responds to user inputs.
3. ui.R: Contains the user interface layout, determining what the user sees and interacts with.

Running the App
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open R or RStudio and set the working directory to the folder containing the app.
3. Run the app using the following command:
   library(shiny)
   runApp()
